# ALX System Engineering and DevOps 

## Description
This track focuses on doing difficult things where we are learning DevOps by following the curriculum from the basics of Linux Navigation, Bash commands, advanced Bash scripting etc.

Git and Github acts as the complementary technologies that completes the stack for FullStack development as they allow collaboration, providing codespaces and easy sharing of my work with other peers.
